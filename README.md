# fantasy_football_project

The goal of this project is to create a fantasy premier league web application which uses a more detailed scoring system than many of the most common sites being used at the moment. The goal will be to encourage players to create balanced teams, rewarding defensive and creative aspects of the game as well as goal scoring. I will create a more detailed description of the scoring system as it develops. There are currently two main apps within this django project, epl_players and draft. 

<b> elp_players </b>    
The purpose of this app is to maintain all of the Premier League data necessary to run the site

<b> draft </b>    
This app will be for the draft verion of the game. In the future I am hoping to include other ways of playing the game including a version where users can have the same players as each other and a version where teams  are redrafted every week.
